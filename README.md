# MNIST-Model
This repository will be used to store my trained MNIST model. It will be trained using Tensorflow and the MNIST dataset, and will be the basis of the code gone over at the WEAP MNIST Workshop on January 30th 2025.

We are using the following libraries:
TensorFlow
Numpy
Seaborn
MatPlotLib (MPL)
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib seaborn
